Hola! How are you guys doing? 
I am still learning git & github. 
Still piecing up each of the puzzles to get the complete pictures. 
git merge vs git rebase?
git pull vs git fetch + merge?
fork, clone, adding remote link to upstream?
local cloned repo 1 commit ahead/behind of remote repo? why?

-_-
